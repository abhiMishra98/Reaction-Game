# Reaction-Game
A reaction time game on RTOS where a randomly generated number is displayed on a 7-segment display, and the player must press a button as quickly as possible. The corresponding reaction time is recorded. Simultaneously, a parallel task controls the sequential fading of LEDs (red, green, blue).
